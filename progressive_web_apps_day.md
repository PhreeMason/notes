## Christina Kayastha

Web use data

- 87% apps
- 13% mobile sites

But:

- 0 average new app downloads/month
- 100 new website visits/month

53% users abandon sites which take longer than 3 seconds to load

### Anatomy of a notification

Must be:

- timely
- precise
- relevant

## Praveen Aravamudham

## blah

Users would rather see fake content than a spinner or no content at all

## App notes

are selected cities not initialized before saveselectedcities?

what is navigator

what is waitUntil

check out `else` in `getForecast` to see loading fake data

what is event.respondWith

WAIT, is the RETURNED value of a method passed into the callback function as a parameter??? Or is that something special??? I never realized that might be the case...

## Anatomy of an App Shell

serve the shell from /shell

(basically anything that is always going to be loaded for every page in your application before being populated with data)

## service workers without the work

sw-precache

gulp + sw-precache = service worker
