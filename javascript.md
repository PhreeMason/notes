#JavaScript notes

###Template literals

Use backticks (`` ` ``) to use templates in a string; you can insert variables or evaluate js by enclosing them ``var inAString = `like ${this()}` ``

###Find keys of object / whether it is empty or not

Use `Object.keys(someObject)` to return an array of keys (properties) of your object, which is useful for determining if an object is empty
